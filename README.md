 A multi-platform, extendable macro and hotkey C library

## Building source ##

 Required build tools:
 * qmake
   * Optionally built with QtCreator, instructions not included

### Style source ###

 Libmacro has a common style to help collaboration.  The program `astyle` is
 required.  To style source execute `./style` in the project base directory.
 `./style` is a bash script, and may also be executed from any directory to
 format any h, hpp, c, and cpp files in that directory.
